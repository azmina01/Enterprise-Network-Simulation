# Enterprise-Network-Simulation
For our enterprise network, we decided to implement a network for an office building. This
building will satisfy the various conditions and requirements we have placed on it.
1. Our office building will have 3 floors
2. Each floor will have their own departments unique to each floor
3. For Floor 1, it will have departments for Reception, Store, Logistics and General
Management
4. For Floor 2, it will have departments for Sales, Human-Resources and Finance
5. For Floor 3, it will have departments for IT and Admin
6. For all departments, except for General Management, it will have its own VLAN
network assigned to it
7. Both Floor 1 and Floor 2 will have an access point for connecting with Wireless
Devices
8. Each department, except for General Management, will have at least 1 pc and 1
printer
9. The routers connecting each floor will be connected via LAN and through a VLAN
Network
Using our method for creating the network for the office building, we could enjoy several key
benefits such as the following.
1. Less congested network traffic between floors due to the VLAN networking
2. Other departments from different departments would not be able to view the data
from other floors which is a key security feature in of itself
3. Extremely ease of use in adding new departments to the system as a new VLAN just
needs to be assigned to it
4. Clear and concise paths for each PC to reach its destination the fastest due to the
use of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol
